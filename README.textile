h1. Gistory

Check out commit 3f0aa20b05ad855e884111b10066cd9d821438f4 for last working version; gistiry is undergoing a big refactor and HEAD may not function properly right now (I will move the development to a branch soon).

Gistory visualizes all the changes to a file in a git repository; gistory does this by opening a browser window and then animating each change to the file over time.

This will be filled out real soon now.
